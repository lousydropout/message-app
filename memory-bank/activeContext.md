# Active Context: MessageAI Project

## Current Status

**EPIC 2.1 MOBILE LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT COMPLETE**: Successfully implemented background/foreground handling with AppState listeners, toast notifications (Expo Go equivalent of push notifications), and battery optimization through SQLite caching and optimized re-rendering. **EPIC 5.1 AI FEATURES 80% COMPLETE**: Advanced AI translation with tool calling, RAG integration, and two-phase translation system implemented. **DATA MANAGEMENT & SYNC OPTIMIZATION COMPLETE**: Successfully implemented sequential message processing and completed Epic 3.2 data management optimizations. **PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE**: Firestore security rules and optimized indexes deployed to production.

### What Was Implemented

**Epic 2.1 Mobile Lifecycle Management:**

- âœ… **Background/Foreground Handling**: AppState listeners for presence management
- âœ… **Toast Notifications**: User feedback system (Expo Go equivalent of push notifications)
- âœ… **Battery Optimization**: SQLite caching reduces Firebase queries and network usage
- âœ… **Optimized Re-rendering**: Memoization and FlashList for performance

**Epic 5.1 AI Features (80% Complete):**

- âœ… **Context-Aware Translation**: AI analyzes conversation history for accurate translations
- âœ… **Tool Calling System**: AI can request additional context when confidence is low (>95% threshold)
- âœ… **RAG Integration**: SQLite FTS5 search for relevant conversation context
- âœ… **Two-Phase Translation**: Exploratory phase determines if more context is needed
- âœ… **MiniGraph Orchestration**: LangGraph-style state machine for complex AI workflows
- âœ… **Cultural Context**: Automatic cultural notes and formality guidance
- âœ… **Language Detection**: Automatic source language identification
- âœ… **Confidence Scoring**: AI provides confidence levels for translation accuracy
- âœ… **Reference Analysis**: Identifies and explains references to earlier messages
- âœ… **Real-time Progress**: Live status updates during translation process

**Epic 3.2 Data Management:**

- âœ… **Sequential Message Processing**: Replaced batch processing with sequential processing to maintain message order
- âœ… **Race Condition Prevention**: Messages processed one by one to prevent ordering issues
- âœ… **Error Handling**: Maintained retry logic for failed messages while continuing to next message
- âœ… **Performance Optimization**: Reduced delay from 100ms between batches to 50ms between messages
- âœ… **Memory Management**: Conversation lifecycle with load/unload patterns for bounded memory usage

### Key Technical Changes

**Message Processing Architecture:**

- Replaced batch processing loop with sequential `for` loop
- Removed `BATCH_SIZE` constant and batch slicing logic
- Updated logging to show "Processing message X of Y" instead of batch information
- Maintained error handling with retry counts and failed message marking

**Performance Improvements:**

- Sequential processing eliminates race conditions between message batches
- Reduced processing delays from 100ms between batches to 50ms between messages
- Guaranteed message ordering throughout the entire queue processing lifecycle
- Maintained mutex protection to prevent concurrent queue processing

**Code Quality:**

- Simplified queue processing logic by removing nested batch loops
- Improved logging granularity for better debugging
- Maintained all existing error handling and retry mechanisms
- Clean separation between message processing and error recovery

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities

1. **Complete AI Features (Epic 5.1 - 20% remaining)**

   - Implement formality adjustment for tone matching
   - Add slang/idiom explanations for informal language
   - Complete the remaining AI features for international communicators

2. **Performance Optimization (Epic 2.2)**

   - Implement virtual scrolling for 1000+ messages with 60 FPS
   - Add message pagination for large conversation histories
   - Optimize scrolling performance for large message lists

3. **Documentation & Deployment (Epic 4)**

   - Add architecture diagrams and visual system overview
   - Document environment variables and configuration
   - Add comprehensive code comments and inline documentation

### Medium Term (Next Epics)

1. **Epic 5**: Complete AI Features Implementation (formality, slang explanations)
2. **Epic 4**: Documentation & Deployment (architecture diagrams, demo video)
3. **Epic 6**: Required Deliverables (demo video, social media post)
