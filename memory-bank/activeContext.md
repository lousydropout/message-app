# Active Context: MessageAI Project

## Current Status

**DATA MANAGEMENT & SYNC OPTIMIZATION COMPLETE**: Successfully implemented sequential message processing and completed Epic 3.2 data management optimizations. The unified queue-first architecture now processes messages sequentially to maintain order and prevent race conditions.

## Recent Major Accomplishment

**Sequential Message Processing & Epic 3.2 Completion** âœ… **COMPLETE**

### What Was Implemented

- âœ… **Sequential Message Processing**: Replaced batch processing with sequential processing to maintain message order
- âœ… **Race Condition Prevention**: Messages processed one by one to prevent ordering issues
- âœ… **Error Handling**: Maintained retry logic for failed messages while continuing to next message
- âœ… **Performance Optimization**: Reduced delay from 100ms between batches to 50ms between messages
- âœ… **Epic 3.2 Completion**: All data management and sync optimizations complete
- âœ… **Memory Management**: Conversation lifecycle with load/unload patterns for bounded memory usage

### Key Technical Changes

**Message Processing Architecture:**

- Replaced batch processing loop with sequential `for` loop
- Removed `BATCH_SIZE` constant and batch slicing logic
- Updated logging to show "Processing message X of Y" instead of batch information
- Maintained error handling with retry counts and failed message marking

**Performance Improvements:**

- Sequential processing eliminates race conditions between message batches
- Reduced processing delays from 100ms between batches to 50ms between messages
- Guaranteed message ordering throughout the entire queue processing lifecycle
- Maintained mutex protection to prevent concurrent queue processing

**Code Quality:**

- Simplified queue processing logic by removing nested batch loops
- Improved logging granularity for better debugging
- Maintained all existing error handling and retry mechanisms
- Clean separation between message processing and error recovery

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities

1. **UI Integration for Online Presence**

   - Add online indicators to ContactsList component
   - Add online status to ConversationView participants
   - Implement visual indicators for online/offline status

2. **Testing & Validation**

   - Test sequential message processing with multiple queued messages
   - Verify message ordering is maintained during offline â†’ online transitions
   - Test error handling with failed messages and retry logic
   - Validate memory usage with conversation lifecycle management

### Medium Term (Next Epics)

1. **Epic 2**: Mobile App Quality (background/foreground, push notifications)
2. **Epic 5**: AI Features Implementation (translation, cultural context)
3. **Epic 4**: Documentation & Deployment (README, demo video)
