## 🚨 Current Issues & Analysis

### Epic 3.2: Data Management & Sync - PLANNING COMPLETE

**Status**: Comprehensive architecture designed, ready for implementation

**Problem Identified**: Current offline sync has fundamental issues:

- `syncQueuedMessages()` doesn't properly send queued messages to Firestore
- Complex dual-path logic (online vs offline) creates maintenance burden
- No idempotency - messages can be duplicated during sync
- Missing incremental sync for missed messages

**Solution Designed**: Unified queue-first architecture with three-tier data flow:

```
Firestore (Authoritative Truth - Expensive)
    ↓ (Real-time subscription + Incremental sync)
SQLite (Persistent Cache - ALL messages)
    ↓ (Load most recent 200 on conversation open)
Zustand (In-Memory Window - Last 200 messages)
```

**Key Architectural Decisions Made**:

1. **Unified Queue-First Flow**: ALL messages go through queue regardless of online/offline status
2. **UUID-Based Idempotency**: Same UUID throughout message lifecycle prevents duplicates
3. **Three-Tier Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns between Firestore, SQLite, and Zustand
4. **Windowed Zustand**: Last 200 messages per conversation to prevent memory bloat
5. **Incremental Sync**: Use lastSyncedAt to fetch only new messages efficiently
6. **Rename tempId → messageId**: Improve code clarity (it was never temporary)

**Implementation Plan Ready**: 11-step implementation plan with comprehensive testing strategy

## 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes Completed

### Android Text Cutoff Bug Resolution ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Problem**: Persistent Android text cutoff in message bubbles where characters were being cut off ("Hi" → "H", "Apple" → "Appl")

**Root Cause**: Android font metrics miscalculations where React Native's Yoga layout engine thinks text block is 19.5px tall but glyphs actually need 20px, resulting in the last pixel being cut off.

**Solutions Applied**:

- [x] **FlashList Migration**: Replaced FlatList with FlashList from @shopify/flash-list for better Android layout engine
- [x] **Android Text Properties**: Applied comprehensive Android-specific text rendering properties
- [x] **Layout Container Fixes**: Applied Android-specific container properties to prevent layout miscalculations
- [x] **Simple Space Fix**: Added extra space at end of each message to prevent character cutoff
- [x] **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Ensured consistent text rendering across iOS and Android

**Files Modified**:

- `components/MessageBubble.tsx` - Main text rendering component
- `components/ConversationView.tsx` - Message list container
- `components/ConversationsList.tsx` - Home screen conversation list
- `components/UserSearch.tsx` - Search results list
- `components/ContactsList.tsx` - Friends list
- `package.json` - Added @shopify/flash-list dependency

**Result**: Complete resolution of Android text cutoff issues with consistent cross-platform text rendering.
